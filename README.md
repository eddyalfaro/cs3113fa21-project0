## Compiling
compiling can be done with the command "make all"

## Executing
Once the file has binary has been compiled the program can be executed as 
```
./project0 <INPUTFILE
```

The program has already a set of files to run as an input if you use the command 

```
make run
```

this set of files will be used and the output will e presented in the terminal.

## Bugs
Bugs can be expected when a file with utf characters that are more than 7 bytes long is input. This will not hinder the running of the program. however, the count of bytes and characters will be offset and the output character will not correspond to those shown in the input file.
